## Project Description
The **Blockchain-Based Intelligent Scholarship Portal** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to streamline and automate the scholarship disbursement process. Leveraging **Hyperledger Fabric**, the portal ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in awarding scholarships. The platform uses **Golang smart contracts** for backend logic and **PostgreSQL** for storing user-related data securely.

Key objectives:
- Automate scholarship verification and approval.
- Maintain immutable records of all transactions.
- Provide a seamless experience for students and institutions.

## Features
- **Secure Login:** Student and institutional authentication.
- **Scholarship Management:** Submit, verify, and approve scholarship requests.
- **Blockchain Integration:** All transactions recorded on Hyperledger Fabric.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automate scholarship allocation logic using Golang chaincode.
- **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL database for storing user and transaction data.
- **Real-time Updates:** Dashboard for students and institutions to track application status.
